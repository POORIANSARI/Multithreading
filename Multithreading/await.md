I did not catch the point
await is non blocking if there is no blocking term inside what we are awaiting?
await is blocking there is some blocking term?
is that true?

Ah, I see where the confusion is 👌
Let’s clear this up step by step, because the distinction is subtle but super important.

🧵 Is await blocking or non-blocking?
1️⃣ The key insight

👉 await itself is always non-blocking.
What matters is what kind of task you are awaiting.

If the awaited task is asynchronous/non-blocking (like Task.Delay, HttpClient.GetAsync, DbCommand.ExecuteReaderAsync) → no thread is blocked.

If the awaited task is really a wrapper around blocking code (like Task.Run(() => Thread.Sleep(...))) → a thread is still blocked inside the task, even though await doesn’t block the caller.

2️⃣ Example A – True async (non-blocking)
await Task.Delay(2000);


Task.Delay sets up a timer.

No thread is blocked.

When the timer fires, continuation runs.

✔️ Non-blocking.

3️⃣ Example B – Async wrapper around blocking code
await Task.Run(() => Thread.Sleep(2000));


Here, Thread.Sleep blocks a ThreadPool thread.

await doesn’t block your caller’s thread, but a thread is still wasted internally.

✔️ Caller is free → but you paid the cost of blocking another thread.

4️⃣ Example C – Fake async (blocking disguised as Task)
Task MyFunc()
{
Thread.Sleep(2000); // blocks here immediately
return Task.CompletedTask;
}

await MyFunc();


Here the blocking happens before the Task is even returned.

So your thread is blocked anyway.

The await sees a completed task → it doesn’t even suspend.

✔️ Blocking.

5️⃣ The Rule of Thumb

await is never the blocker.

The thing you await decides whether there is blocking or not.

👉 await just says:

“Pause my method until this Task is done, and in the meantime, don’t block my current thread.”

If the task itself is async → no blocking.
If the task hides sync blocking work → a thread is still stuck inside that task.

✅ Summary in one line:
await is always non-blocking — but if the task you await uses blocking operations inside, then some other thread will be blocked.
