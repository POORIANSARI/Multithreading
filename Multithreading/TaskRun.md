Great 👍 this is exactly the next “aha!” point.
At first, many devs think:

“If Task.Delay is non-blocking and better, why ever use Task.Run?”

Let’s unpack it carefully.

🧵 When Task.Run is Actually Useful
1️⃣ CPU-bound Work (Heavy Computations)

Example: image processing, encryption, data crunching.

await Task.Run(() =>
{
// Heavy CPU-bound operation
for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++) { }
Console.WriteLine("Calculation done!");
});


Without Task.Run, this loop would run on the caller’s thread → blocking UI or ASP.NET request thread.

With Task.Run, the heavy work runs on a ThreadPool thread → caller thread stays responsive.

👉 Rule of thumb: Use Task.Run to offload CPU-bound work.

2️⃣ Isolating Blocking Calls

Sometimes you are stuck with APIs that block (e.g., old libraries, File.ReadAllBytes, SqlCommand.ExecuteReader).

await Task.Run(() =>
{
var bytes = File.ReadAllBytes("bigfile.dat"); // blocking I/O
return bytes;
});


Ideally, you’d use await File.ReadAllBytesAsync.

But if only sync APIs exist, Task.Run prevents your UI/request thread from freezing.

3️⃣ Parallelism (Run Multiple at Once)
var task1 = Task.Run(() => DoWork("A"));
var task2 = Task.Run(() => DoWork("B"));

await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);


Both tasks run in parallel on different ThreadPool threads.

You get speedup if work is CPU-bound.

4️⃣ Fire-and-Forget Work (with Caution)

If you need to run something in the background without blocking the caller, Task.Run is sometimes used:

Task.Run(() => LogToFile("something happened"));


⚠️ But careful:

No error propagation (unobserved exceptions).

No cancellation control.

Better: use proper background services (e.g., IHostedService in ASP.NET Core).

5️⃣ Offloading Work in ASP.NET Core (Rare Case)

In ASP.NET Core, requests are already handled on ThreadPool threads, so Task.Run is usually unnecessary.
But sometimes you want to:

Avoid starving request threads with long CPU-bound work.

Offload to background processing (e.g. queue).

🚫 When NOT to Use Task.Run

Don’t wrap async I/O (await HttpClient.GetAsync) inside Task.Run.

It just wastes a ThreadPool thread while the real I/O is waiting.

Use the async API instead.

// BAD ❌
await Task.Run(() => httpClient.GetAsync("http://..."));

✅ Summary

Use Task.Delay → for waiting without blocking.

Use Task.Run →

Offload CPU-bound work

Shield caller thread from blocking APIs

Parallelize independent computations
